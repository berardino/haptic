These are the two applications I implemented as part of 
my [master thesis project](http://sirslab.diism.unisi.it/fetouch/index.htm)
back in the 2002! I have found the source code on one of my
hard drives and thought that it was worth to share.

I am planning to update this project so that it can compile
and run on mac/linux. Then I will try to port both applications
to rust and implement an haptic rust library that can be 
used for all devs out there interested on implementing haptic
applications!
